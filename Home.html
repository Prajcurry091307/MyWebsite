            summer after my sophmore year and have beeen updating it and working on it since then. This website will help you 
            explore more about me from my basic interests to my college level acheivements in competitions and more. To start of
            let me explain my background I was born in Bangalore, India. I have studied in 9 different schools throughout 
            my 16 or so years of education. A fun fact about me is that I lived in all the coasts of the united states. I first moved to
            Boston, MA (East Coast) in 2014 then moved back to India in 2016. Later on, I moved to Austin, Texas (Central Coast) in 2018 and then
            moved to dry and hot California (West Coast) in 2021.
